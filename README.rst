* pytest
* Sphinx
* tox
* twine


Usage
-----

In order to use this template you first need to clone this repo locally:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ git clone git@github.com:mundoalem/template-python-project.git
  $ cd template-python-project/

After you finish cloning the template you can start using it right away, however
it may be better to make the project your own by:

- Configure `setup.cfg` file with your project details.
- Configure in `tox.ini` file the `envlist` property with the Python versions you need.
- Add your license to `LICENSE` file.
- Update the license header in all Python files.
- Configure in `.coveragerc` the `source` property of your project (usually the name of the project).
- Update test files under `tests` directory.
- Make sure you are using the correct Python versions in the jobs configured in `.github/workflows`.
- Update the `README.md` with your project information.

All pipeline jobs can be also run locally by ivoking ``pipenv`` scripts, example:

.. code-block:: bash
  
  $ pipenv run build
  $ pipenv run lint
  $ pipenv run test
  $ pipenv run scan
  $ pipenv run release


Environment Variables
---------------------

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to
your .env file

Conduct
-------

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual
orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, income or similar personal characteristic.

Please be kind and courteous. There's no need to be mean or rude. Respect that people have differences of opinion and
that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a right answer,
merely an optimal answer given a set of values and circumstances.

Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and see
how it works.

We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass anyone. That is not welcome behaviour. We interpret
the term "harassment" as including the definition in the `Citizen Code of Conduct <http://citizencodeofconduct.org/>`_;
if you have any lack of clarity about what might be included in that concept, please read their definition. In
particular, we don't tolerate behavior that excludes people in socially marginalized groups.

Whether you're a regular contributor or a newcomer, we care about making this community a safe place for you and we've
got your back.

Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behaviour is not welcome.


Communication
-------------

GitHub issues are the primary way for communicating about specific proposed changes to this project.

In both contexts, please follow the conduct guidelines above. Language issues are often contentious and we'd like to
keep discussion brief, civil and focused on what we're actually doing, not wandering off into too much imaginary stuff.

FAQ
---

**Will there ever be support for other continuous integration platforms?**

Right now I have no plans to support other platforms like TravisCI, CircleCI or Gitlab. Anyway, it should be quite easy
for you to port the GitHub Actions to any platform you like.

The reason for that is that I don't want to have a `.travis.yml`, a `circleci.yml` and a `.gitlab-ci.yml` all together
in the same place when only one would actually be used. So I want to avoid (for now) cluttering the template with too
many files that might or might not be useful.

**Do you have plans to build and release for multiple architectures?**

Yes, in the future I want to enable the pipeline to also compile a Python project and generate a binary for multiple
platforms.
